                     <p>It's nice to have those around you who can encourage you and criticize you in a beneficial way. It builds you up as a person and brings everyone closer. The closer you all are, the more you guys will get along and be able to work together as one.</p>
                    
                <h2>Strength</h2>
                     <p>These people who you work with whether it be in sports, a group assignment, work projects, etc., will be the ones who lift you up with them. You all carry one another and push each other to the top to be the best you can be. If there's no one there to help you out, you won't get very far when it comes to trying to achieve your goal(s).</p>
                    
                    <strong></p>Lift them up as they lift you up work on what you should be doing: improving yourself.</strong></p>
                    
                <h2>Attitude</h2>
                    
                    <p>Working as a team can definitely improve your attitude. For example, if you lost, and weren't really too close with your team, you would just feel the burden of losing/not being too successful and may or may not be a good sport about it. That's why it is so important to have people around you who will make every experience you have in whatever you do <i>enjoyable.</i> </p>
