                    <p>"Live in the present, and you will be happy"</p>
                    
                     <p>A lot of people tend to overlook the little things and focus on what's in store. But people need to realize that it's not always all about looking forward to the future. Looking for satisfaction in the future and not living in the present will prevent you from any contentment and happiness in your life. Appreciate the people around you, and appreciate what is going on now, whether it be sitting in class, waiting in line, or driving around.</p>
                    
                <h2>Let It Go</h2>
                     <p>Now, I'm sure we've all heard the song "Let It Go" from that popular movie, <i>Frozen</i>. Who hasn't? Its title is even on point. Just let free. Whatever grudge or horrid, scarring past history you have had in your life, try to let if go, even if it has to be little by little and takes a while. Focus on <b>yourself</b> and don't care about what other people may say or think of you. </p>
                    
                    <p>Now, if you held grudges constantly, would that be considered enjoying life? </p>

                    <p>No, of course not.</p>
                    
                    <p>Don't dwell on what they do or have done to you; accept that they may not change their minds about you. While they do that, <strong>work on what you should be doing: improving yourself.</strong></p>
                    
                <h2>Work On Yourself</h2>
                    
                    <p>Now, what should you be doing as those haters and irrelevant people in your life keep trying to drag you down?</p>

                    <p>Work on making <i>yourself</i>   a better person.</p>
                    <h4>There's only one person who can ultimately make you happy:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <ol>You.</ol>
                    
                    </ul>
                
                <h3>There is nothing anyone hates more than someone they dislike and loathe who is happy and                            successful.</h3>
                    
                    <p>So, be that person. You do that and you will definitely learn to tune out those toxic people and learn to enjoy your life and be happy.</p>
                   
                    <h4>Stick With Friends Who:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bring out your best self</li>
                            <li>Make you laugh until you cry</li>
                            <li>Appreciate life</li>
</ul>
                    
                    <h2><emphasis>Get Rid Of Those Toxic People</emphasis></h2>

                    <p>Just throw them out the door. Cut them out of your life. You really do not need any of their unencouraging, hurtful comments and actions. You'll get <b>nowhere</b> if you keep on surrounding yourself with the people who bring you down. Why keep them in your life anyway? If they do not bring you the support and happiness in your life, then they obviously do not benefit you, which means, they're basically worthless. You want to move up, not down.</p>
                
                <h2>Motivational, Inspiring Quotes</h2>
                    
                    <p>I know, I know. Motivational quotes. Sounds completely cheesy, right? But believe it or not, they actually do get you thinking if you're open to it. They help you see different perspectives on how to look at life and how to be happy. It's nice to have some <a href="http://www.positivityblog.com/index.php/2013/08/20/happiness-quotes/">happy quotes</a> in the back of your mind to apply it to your life and even influence others.</p>
